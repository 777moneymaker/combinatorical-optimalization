# Combinatorical optimalization
This program implements Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for a Graph Travelling Problem. 

## Gettin' started
The Graph has a specified set of vertices |V| = min(100, inf), edges |E|, and edge's weights |W|.
Algorithm has to visit each vertex and find path with the lowest cost S = sum(foreach weights_on_path). 
Cost is calculated on the basis of "if current weight is greater than next weight, then add current weight * 10";
